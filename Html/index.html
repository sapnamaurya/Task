        <h1>Engineer</h1>
        <p>
          <img src="../image/eng.jpg" alt="eng" />
          A professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental
          education and training to apply the scientific method and outlook to
          the analysis and solution of engineering problems. He/she is able to
          assume personal responsibility for the development and application of
          engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design,
          construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing, and in the
          education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual
          and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It
          requires the exercise of original thought and judgment and the ability
          to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her
          education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely
          and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering
          science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis,
          assimilating such information, and applying it independently. He/she
          is thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development
          of engineering science or its applications. His/her education and
          training will have been such that he/she will have acquired a broad
          and general appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as
          thorough insight into the special features of his/her own branch. In
          due time he/she will be able to give authoritative technical advice
          and assume responsibility for the direction of important tasks in
          his/her branch.
